# Rock_Paper_Scissors
Objective: To create a Rock, Paper & Scissors game where the user can play via the webcam with the computer.


# Milestone 1
Created a GIT repository for the Rock,Paper Scissors game simulation

# Milestone 2
I have used the teachable machine software to create a machine learning model using my webcam. I created 3 classes ( Rock, Paper & Scissors), where I captures various different images of my hand which corrolated to each class. I then processed this information through program to create the model. This machine could then identify which hand gestrures belonged to which class. After I was satisfied with the accuracy of the model I downloaded the model as a TensorFlow model which will be used on python to program the rest of the game.
